# Oxygen-Prediction
Predict the oxygen value using Vanilla LSTM

#Dataset description:
To implement the proposed methodology, we
created a data-set consists of 220 entries which has three
main features of fire (Oxygen, Temperature, and Humidity).
An increase in both oxygen and temperature as well decrease
in humidity causes fire. Same way, a decrease in oxygen and
temperature but increase in humidity avoids fire occurrence
according to [11]. [11] has provided a WSN data-set which
contains 40 entries and after performing some analysis, we
implemented a 220 entries data by keeping it as a reference.

#Methodology
A Vanilla LSTM is an LSTM model that has a single hidden layer of LSTM units, and an output layer used to make a prediction.
